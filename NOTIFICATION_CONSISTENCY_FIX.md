# 🔔 Notification Consistency Fix

## Problem Description

Previously, there was a mismatch between:
- **App Notifications**: Full message content stored in the app
- **Push Notifications**: Truncated title (first 50 characters) + full body

This caused confusion because users would see different content in the app vs. push notifications.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Backend Notification Service

**Before:**
```java
// Extract title from message (first line or first 50 characters)
String title = message.length() > 50 ? message.substring(0, 50) + "..." : message;
String body = message;
```

**After:**
```java
// Use the exact same message for both title and body to ensure consistency
// Don't truncate - send full message to match app notifications
String title = message; // Full message as title
String body = message;  // Full message as body
```

### 2. Push Notification Service

**Enhanced with:**
- Better message length handling (title: 100 chars, body: 200 chars)
- High priority notifications
- Vibration enabled
- Consistent data payload

### 3. Notification Data

**Added to push notification data:**
```java
Map.of(
    "type", "notification", 
    "notificationId", notification.getId(),
    "message", message // Include full message in data
)
```

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### 1. Notification Creation
1. Backend creates notification with full message
2. Message is stored in database exactly as provided
3. Same full message is sent as push notification

### 2. Push Notification Delivery
1. **Title**: Full message (truncated only if >100 characters for mobile display)
2. **Body**: Full message (truncated only if >200 characters for mobile display)
3. **Data**: Contains full message, notification ID, and type

### 3. Mobile App Display
1. **Push Notification**: Shows full message content
2. **App Notifications**: Shows full message content
3. **Consistency**: Both display the exact same information

## 📱 Example Notifications

### Follow-up Creation
**Message**: `📅 Follow-up created for lead "John Doe" scheduled for 2024-01-15 at 14:30`

**Before (Inconsistent):**
- App: `📅 Follow-up created for lead "John Doe" scheduled for 2024-01-15 at 14:30`
- Push: `📅 Follow-up created for lead "John Doe" scheduled for 2024-01-15 at 14:30...` (truncated)

**After (Consistent):**
- App: `📅 Follow-up created for lead "John Doe" scheduled for 2024-01-15 at 14:30`
- Push: `📅 Follow-up created for lead "John Doe" scheduled for 2024-01-15 at 14:30` (full message)

### Task Reminder
**Message**: `⏰ Reminder: You have a follow-up TODAY for lead "Jane Smith" at 15:00`

**Before (Inconsistent):**
- App: `⏰ Reminder: You have a follow-up TODAY for lead "Jane Smith" at 15:00`
- Push: `⏰ Reminder: You have a follow-up TODAY for lead "Jane Smith" at 15:00...` (truncated)

**After (Consistent):**
- App: `⏰ Reminder: You have a follow-up TODAY for lead "Jane Smith" at 15:00`
- Push: `⏰ Reminder: You have a follow-up TODAY for lead "Jane Smith" at 15:00` (full message)
