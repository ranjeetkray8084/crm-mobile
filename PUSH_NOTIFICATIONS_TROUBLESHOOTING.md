# üîî Push Notifications Troubleshooting Guide

## üìã **Current Status Analysis**

Based on the logs and configuration analysis, your push notification setup is **correctly configured** but there are several issues preventing them from working:

### ‚úÖ **What's Working:**
- Firebase configuration is correct
- All required dependencies are installed
- App configuration is properly set up
- Backend integration is working (test endpoint responds successfully)

### ‚ùå **What's Not Working:**
- App is generating fallback tokens instead of real FCM tokens
- Firebase messaging service is not properly initialized
- Push notifications are not being received on the device

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Issue 1: Fallback Mode Active**
```
LOG  ‚ö†Ô∏è Firebase not configured, trying alternative method...
LOG  üì± Attempting to get push token without Firebase...
LOG  ‚ö†Ô∏è Could not get push token, using fallback mode
LOG  üîß Generating fallback token for testing...
```

**Problem:** The app is falling back to generating fake tokens instead of using Firebase.

**Solution:** The app needs to be built and run as a native app, not in Expo Go.

### **Issue 2: Project ID Mismatch (FIXED)**
- **Before:** EAS project ID was `e54487e4-0b6f-4429-8b02-f1c84f6b0bba`
- **After:** Now correctly set to `crmnativeexpo` (matching Firebase project)

### **Issue 3: Missing Firebase Integration (FIXED)**
- Created `FirebaseMessagingService.ts` for proper FCM handling
- Updated `NotificationService.ts` to use Firebase first, then fallback to Expo

## üöÄ **Solutions & Next Steps**

### **Step 1: Build Native App (REQUIRED)**
```bash
# Don't use: expo start (Expo Go)
# Use this instead:
expo run:android
```

**Why?** Push notifications require native code compilation. Expo Go cannot generate real FCM tokens.

### **Step 2: Verify Device Setup**
- Use a **physical Android device** (not emulator)
- Ensure device has **Google Play Services** installed
- Grant **notification permissions** when prompted

### **Step 3: Check Firebase Console**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project: `crmnativeexpo`
3. Go to Project Settings > Cloud Messaging
4. Verify your app is registered
5. Check if FCM tokens are being generated

### **Step 4: Test Push Notifications**
1. **From Backend:** Use the test endpoint that's already working
2. **From Firebase Console:** Send test message
3. **From Your App:** Check logs for FCM token generation

## üîß **Code Changes Made**

### **1. Updated app.config.js**
- Fixed project ID mismatch
- Added Firebase messaging plugin
- Enhanced notification configuration

### **2. Created FirebaseMessagingService.ts**
- Proper FCM token generation
- Background/foreground message handling
- Token registration with backend

### **3. Enhanced NotificationService.ts**
- Firebase-first approach
- Better fallback handling
- Improved error logging

## üì± **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] App built with `expo run:android`
- [ ] Running on physical device (not emulator)
- [ ] Notification permissions granted
- [ ] FCM token generated (check logs)
- [ ] Token registered with backend
- [ ] Test notification sent from backend
- [ ] Notification received on device

## üö® **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue: "Firebase not configured"**
**Solution:** Build with `expo run:android` instead of `expo start`

### **Issue: "Permission denied"**
**Solution:** Check device notification settings and app permissions

### **Issue: "No FCM token generated"**
**Solution:** Verify Firebase project configuration and app signing

### **Issue: "Backend not receiving tokens"**
**Solution:** Check API endpoint, authentication, and network connectivity

### **Issue: "Notifications not showing"**
**Solution:** Check notification channel configuration and device settings

## üîç **Debug Commands**

### **Check Current Setup:**
```bash
node test-push-setup.js
```

### **View App Logs:**
```bash
expo logs
```

### **Build and Run:**
```bash
expo run:android
```

### **Clear Cache:**
```bash
expo start --clear
```

## üìû **Getting Help**

If issues persist after following this guide:

1. **Check Logs:** Look for specific error messages
2. **Verify Firebase:** Ensure project configuration is correct
3. **Test Device:** Try on different physical device
4. **Check Backend:** Verify API endpoints are working
5. **Review Permissions:** Ensure all required permissions are granted

## üéØ **Expected Outcome**

After implementing these solutions, you should see:
- Real FCM tokens generated (not fallback tokens)
- Successful token registration with backend
- Push notifications received on device
- Proper Firebase integration working

**Remember:** Push notifications require native compilation. Expo Go is for development only and cannot handle real push notifications.
